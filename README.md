## What is click-to-call?

The definition of click-to-call (which is sometimes called click-to-talk, or click-to-text) refers to a type of digital communication in which a person clicks a button or text in order to be connected with another individual in real-time. These connections can occur via phone call, SMS or Voice-over-Internet-Protocol (VoIP). These click-to-call links are commonly found as buttons on websites. But often, click-to-call can be initiated by hyperlinks over emails and videos.

## Getting started

After `npm install` run:

> Note: Rollup automatically takes care about
> hot reloading after source files change.

## Production build

Production build is generated using:

```
npm run build
```

into `dist/ctc.min.js`.

## Using on webpage

After project is built paste this code snippet into website `<head />` tag:

> **View** `index.html`

```
<script
      async
      defer
      src="dist/ctc.min.js"
      data-uri="sip:<USERNAME>@<PBX_URL>"
      data-user="<USERNAME>"
      data-password="<PASSWORD>"
      data-socket="wss://<PBX_WEBSOCKET_URL>"
      data-callto="sip:<NUMBER_TO_CALL>@<PBX_URL>"
      <!-- data-color="green"  -->  Custom color
      <!-- data-position="left"  -->  Custom position ('right' is default)
      <!-- data-text="Call us!"  -->  Custom bubble text
>
</script>
```

> **Do not forget**: Update `src` path if you will be using different folder structure!

## Customizing automatic run

Current version is developed with running script immediately after its load with `data-` attributes. You can modify this behavior in `src/index.ts` file.
